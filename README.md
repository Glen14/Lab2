# Book Management System

## Description
This is a simple book management project by me. The application allows users to input details about books (title, author, and publication year). The books are stored in a session and displayed on the same page. The system ensures that all fields are filled before adding a book and handles errors. I had some issues while working with sessions. Hence, I took some reference form the internet.

## Files

- `index.php`: Main script for handling form submissions, processing data, and displaying books.
- `Book.php`: PHP class file defining the `Book` class with methods to get and set book attributes.
